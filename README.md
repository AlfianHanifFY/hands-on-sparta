## ABOUT
Welcome to my portfolio website! This project was developed to fulfill the Day 1 assignment for the SPARTA 23 program and was created over the course of approximately one week. The website serves as a platform to showcase my personal information and projects.

The design of this portfolio is inspired by the bento box layout, featuring multiple sections, each containing specific information. The site takes full advantage of Tailwind CSS's grid capabilities, allowing for easy expansion. Additional sections can be added simply by updating the data in the `./data-<type>.tsx` files.

## TECHNOLOGIES
This website was built using the following technology stack:

- Next.js: A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the user interface.
- Vercel: A cloud platform for hosting and deploying web applications.
